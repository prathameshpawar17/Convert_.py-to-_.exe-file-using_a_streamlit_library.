Converting a Streamlit App to an Executable (.exe) File
Requirements

Python 3.x (the version your Streamlit app was developed with)
Streamlit library
PyInstaller (for creating the .exe file)
Any other libraries your Streamlit app depends on

Environment Setup

Create a new virtual environment:
Copypython -m venv streamlit_exe_env

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows: streamlit_exe_env\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux: source streamlit_exe_env/bin/activate


Install required packages:
Copypip install streamlit pyinstaller

Install any other dependencies your app requires.

Project Structure
Organize your project as follows:
Copyproject_folder/
│
├── app.py (your main Streamlit app)
├── requirements.txt
└── build_exe.py (script to create the .exe)
Steps to Convert Streamlit App to .exe

Create requirements.txt:
Run this command to generate a list of all installed packages:
Copypip freeze > requirements.txt


Create build_exe.py:
This script will use PyInstaller to create the .exe file

Run the build script:
Copypython build_exe.py

Find your .exe file in the dist folder.

Running the Executable
To run the Streamlit app as an executable:

Open a command prompt.
Navigate to the folder containing your .exe file.
Run the following command:
CopyMyStreamlitApp.exe


This will start a local Streamlit server and open the app in your default web browser.
